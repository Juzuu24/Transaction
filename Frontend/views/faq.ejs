            <br>
            The value of product is adjusted according to the market value.
            The product is randomly assigned according to the total balance of the user account.
            The higher the balance of the user account, the higher the amount of product, and the higher the profit.
            If the user is worried that the amount of product is too large to afford, please do not save too much money to start optimizing.
